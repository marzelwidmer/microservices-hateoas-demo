[[introduction]]
= Introduction

RESTful Customer is a RESTful web service for creating and storing customer. It uses hypermedia
to describe the relationships between resources and to allow navigation between them.


[[getting_started_running_the_service]]
== Running the service
RESTful Customer is written using https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/marzelwidmer/microservices-hateoas-demo.git
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd customer-service/
$ ./gradlew build
$ java -jar build/libs/*0.jar --spring.profiles.active=standalone
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/ContractVerifierTest_validate_shouldReturnIndexResource()/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/ContractVerifierTest_validate_shouldReturnIndexResource()/httpie-request.adoc[]


This request should yield the following response:

include::{snippets}/ContractVerifierTest_validate_shouldReturnIndexResource()/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `_links` in the JSON response. They are key to navigating the API.

https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/docs/3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle[Spring Cloud Contract] documentation.

== Update Producer Contracts
Let imagine we have a new requirement to add a new relation `api-docs`.

[source,groovy]
----
body(
[
"_links": [
        "api-docs"     : [
                "href": value(
                        consumer("http://${fromRequest().header('Host')}/docs/api-guide.html"),
                        producer("http://localhost:8080/docs/api-guide.html"))
        ]
]
----

== Run the Producer Contracts
[source,bash]
----
$ gradle generateContractTests contractTest

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':contractTest'.
> There were failing tests. See the report at: file:///microservices-hateoas-demo/customer-service/build/reports/tests/contractTest/index.html

----

Open the `index.html` then you will see something like this, because you change contracts of the index resource.
----
java.lang.RuntimeException: com.jayway.jsonpath.PathNotFoundException: Missing property in path $['_links']['api-docs']
	at com.toomuchcoding.jsonassert.JsonAsserter.parseJsonPathAsArray(JsonAsserter.java:262)
----
Now you can go a head and implement the missing part on the `index resource`

[source,kotlin]
----
  val API_DOCS_REL = "api-docs"

    @GetMapping
    fun index(): EntityModel<Unit> {
        val selfLink: Link = linkTo(methodOn(IndexResource::class.java).index()).withSelfRel()
        return EntityModel.of(Unit, selfLink).apply {
            add(Link.of("${BasicLinkBuilder.linkToCurrentMapping()}/docs/api-guide.html").withRel(API_DOCS_REL))
----

[source,bash]
----
$ gradle generateContractTests contractTest
